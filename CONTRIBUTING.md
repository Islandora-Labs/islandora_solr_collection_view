Anyone with a github account may create an issue, but there are some constraints (see below) on who may contribute pull requests.

## Constraints on merging 

As with all projects in Islandora Labs, all contributors to a pull request must have an Islandora

Here, a contributor is defined as the author of a git commit.

In Islandora Labs, the policies for merging may be different from the standard [Islandora Committer's Workflow]. 
These policies are set at the discretion of the Current Maintainer, as defined in this project's README.md.

In this project, the following policies apply:
* Only maintainers of this module may merge pull requests.
* A maintainer may merge anyone's pull requests (except their own)
* Formal github review is not required, nor is a courtesy waiting period required.
